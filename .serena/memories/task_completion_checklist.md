# Task Completion Checklist

## Before Considering a Task Complete

1. **TypeScript Compilation**

   - Run `yarn build` to ensure TypeScript compiles without errors
   - Check for type issues and fix any TypeScript errors

2. **Test Execution**

   - Run all tests to ensure they pass: `yarn test`

3. **Code Quality**

   - Ensure code follows TypeScript best practices
   - Use interfaces for structured data types
   - Add proper type annotations and return types
   - Implement proper error handling with type checking
   - Keep console logging appropriate (success indicators, not debugging logs)

4. **Test Coverage**

   - New functionality has associated tests
   - Tests include both success paths and error cases
   - Notifications are properly configured

5. **CI Readiness**

   - Ensure tests will run correctly in CI environment
   - Any environment variables are documented
   - CI workflow file is updated if necessary

6. **Documentation**
   - README.md updated if new features were added
   - New environment variables documented
   - Any new dependencies listed
   - Setup instructions updated if necessary

## YAGNI Principles

- Focus on simplicity and minimal implementation
- Avoid adding features "just in case"
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Follow the existing project patterns
- Keep TypeScript configurations simple without unnecessary complexity
