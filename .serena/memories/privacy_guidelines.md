## Privacy Guidelines for Homelab Monitoring Project

To prevent the unintentional disclosure of private information, all committed files within this project that are *not* encrypted by `git-crypt` (including documentation, specifications, and memory files) must adhere to the following guidelines:

1.  **Generic Naming for Applications/Tools**: When referencing applications or tools being monitored, use generic descriptive terms instead of specific product names. For example, use 'workflow automation app' or 'dashboard visualization tool' instead of proprietary names.

2.  **Abstraction of Private Network Details**: Avoid including specific private network details such as internal domain names, IP addresses, or other unique identifiers that could reveal your homelab's configuration. Use abstract placeholders or general descriptions where such details might otherwise appear.

These guidelines ensure that sensitive information remains private while maintaining clear and understandable project documentation.
