# Task Startup Procedure

For every new task, always follow this exact sequence:

1. Execute `activate_project` with the appropriate project name
2. Execute `initial_instructions` to get project-specific guidelines

This sequence must be performed at the beginning of each new task before any other operations. This ensures proper project context and instructions are loaded.
